# EasyPWA
## A PWA so simple your grandparents could set it up.

### Long story short for a school assignment we had to design/develop an app📱. 
Building a normal app for an iphone is a hassle. **Building a PWA is also a hassle** but less of a hassle. Since theyre a somewhat newer technique Information is a bit scarce and there wasn't anything I could just copy (As a coder I know you love copying!).
So here I made a really easy starter file which with some basic knowledge about js/html you should be able to figure out!

If you want to just play around and see what does what delete code.
go to the Developer tools tab in chrome and go to lighthouse and analyze page load for just the progressive web app. This should give you a better understanding of what does what exactly!

for the creation of the images I just went to the [site](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) and threw in a png file. This also creates a webmanifest 

Good luck!🫡
