# EasyPWA
## A PWA so simple your grandparents could set it up.

### Long story short for a school assignment we had to design/develop an appðŸ“±.

Building a normal app for an iphone is a hassle. **Building a PWA is also a hassle** but less of a hassle. Since they're a somewhat newer technique Information is a bit scarce and there wasn't anything I could just copy **(As a coder I know you love copying!ðŸ˜‰)**. \
So here I made a really easy starter file which with some basic knowledge about js/html you should be able to figure out!

If you want to just play around and see what does what delete code.
go to the Developer tools tab in chrome and go to lighthouse and analyze page load for just the progressive web app. This should give you a better understanding of what does what exactly!

for the creation of the images I just went to the [site](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) and threw in a png file. 
**This also creates a webmanifest.**


### bonus: Tailwind css
For this project I've used the tailwind css framework.
I installed it into this repo so in order to keep working with that 
run these commands: 
    npm install -D tailwindcss
    npx tailwindcss -i ./css/input.css -o ./css/output.css --watch

Have fun building and good luck!ðŸ«¡
